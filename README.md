![Final Score](https://i.ibb.co/DCtw70t/image.png)  

## Project Description  
The `NetPractice` project is a network troubleshooting and subnetting exercise developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It challenges students to understand and apply networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnet masks, and routing to solve various connectivity issues.  

## Journey  
Before starting this project, I had very little knowledge of networking concepts like subnetting and IP addressing. At first, understanding how subnet masks worked and how to divide networks correctly was quite challenging. However, through practice and research, I gradually built a solid understanding. Despite my initial struggles, I managed to complete the project successfully on my first attempt, which was a great achievement.  

## Key Learnings  
- Fundamentals of IP addressing and subnetting  
- Troubleshooting network configurations  
- Implementing proper routing between different subnets  
- Identifying and fixing misconfigurations in a network setup  

## Technical Details  
- The project consists of various network scenarios where I had to:  
  - Assign correct IP addresses and subnet masks.  
  - Configure proper routing to ensure connectivity.  
  - Debug and correct incorrect network setups.  
- Key concepts covered:  
  - CIDR notation and subnet calculations.  
  - Static and dynamic routing principles.  
  - Network troubleshooting methodologies.  

## Project Status  
- **First Attempt**: Success (Fully solved all network configurations)  
- **Completion Time**: ~5 days  

## Challenges Faced  
Since I was new to networking, my biggest challenges included:  
- Understanding subnetting and how to properly allocate addresses.  
- Figuring out how routing tables work and why certain configurations wouldn’t function as expected.  
- Identifying subtle misconfigurations that caused connectivity issues.  

## Reflection  
This project was a steep but rewarding learning curve. It gave me a solid foundation in networking and helped me develop a logical approach to troubleshooting. Looking back, it’s impressive how much I learned in a short period, and I now feel much more confident working with network configurations.  

## Skills Developed  
- Network troubleshooting and debugging  
- IP addressing and subnetting  
- Routing table configuration  
- Logical problem-solving in networking environments
